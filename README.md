<ul>
  <li>🙏 Believes in: 
  <ul>
    <li>C supremacy </li>
    <li>Imperative/procedural and functional programing paradigms supremacy</li>
    <li>Making everything from scratch</li>
    <li>The console, the best debugger</li>
    <li>The more control the better AKA knowing what exactly is going on</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>📝 Notepad (not ++) enthusiast</li>
  <li>👎😕 Goes against:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>OOP</li>
    <li>Any slow interpreted language</li>
    <li>Having a program 95% libraries, 5% own code</li>
    <li>Having to download the nineth library just to get a trivial task done</li>
    <li>Nearly having to "recode the entire OS" just to get the fifteenth library working, or to travel through half internet just to fix an error in a single library</li>
    <li>Getting a project filled with unnecesary files while using an SDK, API or Framework </li>
  </ul>
  <li>🎭 Any C++ code without OOP is just C, so why bother on C++?</li>
  <li>🤘 Defends his position due to:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Witnessing how arguably optimized programs annihilated his toaster</li>
    <li>Being tired of using pirate programs</li>
    <li>Getting tired of some people pretending that every person in the world has a similar pc to theirs</li>
  </ul>
  <li>😔 Wishes to be in a world where the most optimized program is ran by the best computer on the world</li>
  <li>☢ Fan of manual memory management</<li>
  <li>Does have he mentioned he dislikes OOP programing paradigm and Python yet?</li>
  <li>Has no clue on how to use GitHub 👈😂</li>
</ul>
